    Brother Gideon Retief is the Pastor of Emmanuel Gospel Centre, supported by his wife, Sister Cathy. For just under 30 years (since 1994) Brother Gideon assisted his father, Brother Willie in the Ministry and the administration of the Church and its function; the transition being thus, smooth and seamless.
    We thank our Lord for this privilege. In the early 1990’s Br Gideon, supported by an enthusiastic team over the passing years, re-established the printing programme. A printing office was subsequently set up at the EGC Church Camp grounds in Nestpark. By God’s Gracious, Providing Hand, hundreds of thousands of Message books have since been distributed FREE OF CHARGE across South Africa and many other countries across Africa.
    The Ministry, comprising of the five-fold ministry is fervently committed to preach and teach the Redemptive Plan and Purpose of God, without fear or favour; humbly serving the Bride of Christ.

          `I took on the office of a deacon and entered into the ministry, by His leadership. We fellowshipped at Restored Word Centre for about 15 years and then came over to fellowship with Emmanuel Gospel Centre in 1994 under the Pastorship of Br Willie Retief and Br Gideon Retief (associate pastor at that time). Br Willie allowed me the opportunity to minister for the first time at our church in Witfield and we spoke on a subject “Am I my brother’s keeper”. By God’s grace and leadership and strength that was what we have been doing all these years in assisting each one to “stay in line” and looking after their spiritual and natural needs.`,
          `I have been attending Emmanuel Gospel Centre from when it was still at Witfield. I have been serving the Lord for over 31 years and was elected as a deacon at Emmanuel Gospel Centre in 1997. As a deacon, it is a great honour to serve His people as I serve Him. My wife, Carline and I have three married children with two grandchildren, all (by God’s grace) are serving the true Living God following the Message of the Hour.`,
          `Emmanuel Gospel Centre was my first home church and still is. I started fellowshipping here in 1990, (the year I met the Lord and was baptised) and have had the honour of serving in the Body of Christ as an usher and a trustee before I became a deacon in 2002. I found my wife, Estelle (who was raised in the Message) here at the Emmanuel Gospel Centre, and I am blessed with three boys. I deem it a great honour to serve as a deacon together with my wife and give Him all the glory for anything good that I might have in me.`,
          `Being an offspring of the generation that benefited immensely from Brother Willie Retief’s ministry through missionary work across Africa, abroad and Zimbabwe to be specific, little did I know that I would one day be privileged to directly benefit from both his and his son Gideon Retief’s ministry and be a co-worker in serving God’s people. I started fellowshipping at Emmanuel Gospel Centre in 2008. Through surrendering to the call of God in my life, the Lord hath so ordained and made it possible, that I may serve Him as a minister and deacon, in this lovely assembly with the support of my dear wife, Sister Nicole Happiness.`,
