## 🔍 What to Check RIGHT NOW

### ✅ Step 1: Test Webmail Login (MOST IMPORTANT)

**Try logging in here:**  
https://webmail.hostinger.com

**Use exactly:**
- Email: `saintshub@gedeonchrist.com`
- Password: `M#deon@102030`

**Result:**
- ✅ **If it works:** Credentials are correct → Go to Step 2
- ❌ **If it fails:** Password is wrong → Reset it in hPanel

---

### ✅ Step 2: Check SMTP is Enabled in hPanel

1. Login to **hPanel** (https://hpanel.hostinger.com)
2. Go to **Emails** section
3. Click **Email Accounts**
4. Find: `saintshub@gedeonchrist.com`
5. Click **Manage** or settings icon
6. Look for **SMTP Access** or **External Email Client**
7. **Make sure it's ENABLED** ✅

**Common issue:** Hostinger sometimes disables SMTP by default for new accounts!

---

### ✅ Step 3: Check for 2FA or App Passwords

**Does your Hostinger account have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled?**

If YES:
1. Go to hPanel → Security
2. Generate an **App-Specific Password** for SMTP
3. Use THAT password instead of your regular password

---

### ✅ Step 4: Verify Email Configuration in hPanel

In hPanel → Emails → Email Accounts → Your Email:

**Check these settings:**
```
Incoming Server (IMAP): imap.hostinger.com (Port 993)
Outgoing Server (SMTP): smtp.hostinger.com (Port 465 or 587)
```

**Make sure:**
- [ ] SMTP is not disabled
- [ ] No sending restrictions
- [ ] Account is active (not suspended)

---

## 🔧 Alternative: Test with Outlook/Thunderbird

To verify the credentials work, try adding the email to:
- **Microsoft Outlook**
- **Mozilla Thunderbird**
- **Gmail** (as external account)

**Settings to use:**
```
Email: saintshub@gedeonchrist.com
Password: M#deon@102030
SMTP: smtp.hostinger.com
Port: 465 (SSL) or 587 (TLS)
```

**If it works there** → Problem is with our Node.js config  
**If it fails there** → Problem is with Hostinger account/credentials
