# üîß Hostinger Email Setup - Troubleshooting

## ‚ùå Current Error
```
Error: Invalid login: 535 5.7.8 Error: authentication failed
```

This means Hostinger is rejecting the credentials.

---

## ‚úÖ Steps to Fix

### Step 1: Verify Email Address
**Check your Hostinger email address spelling carefully!**

You mentioned: `saintshub@gedeonchirst.com` (with "I")  
But .env has: `saintshub@gedeonchrist.com` (with "H")

**Which one is correct?**
- [ ] saintshub@gedeonchir**s**t.com (with S)
- [ ] saintshub@gedeonchri**s**t.com (with H)

---

### Step 2: Check Password
**Common issues:**
- Password has special characters that need escaping
- Copy/paste added extra spaces
- Caps Lock was on when you set it

**Your password:** `ThisIsMyPass1232`

**Try logging into Hostinger webmail:**
1. Go to: https://webmail.hostinger.com
2. Email: saintshub@gedeonchrist.com (or gedeonchirst.com)
3. Password: ThisIsMyPass1232

‚úÖ **If login works:** Credentials are correct, see Step 3  
‚ùå **If login fails:** Password is wrong, reset it

---

### Step 3: Enable SMTP Access (If Needed)

Some Hostinger accounts require enabling SMTP:

1. **Login to hPanel** (Hostinger control panel)
2. Go to **Emails** ‚Üí **Email Accounts**
3. Find: `saintshub@gedeonchrist.com`
4. Click **Manage**
5. Look for **SMTP Settings** or **External Email Client**
6. Make sure it's **Enabled**

---

### Step 4: Try Alternative Port

If port 465 doesn't work, try port 587:

**Update `.env` to:**
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.hostinger.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false # Use STARTTLS instead of SSL
EMAIL_USER=saintshub@gedeonchrist.com
EMAIL_PASS=ThisIsMyPass1232
```

---

### Step 5: Check for Two-Factor Authentication

If you have 2FA enabled on your Hostinger account:

1. You may need an **App-Specific Password**
2. Go to Hostinger hPanel
3. Security Settings
4. Generate App Password for "SMTP"
5. Use that password instead

---

### Step 6: Verify Domain Spelling

**Check these match:**
- Your actual domain name
- The email address in Hostinger
- The email in `.env` file

**Common typos:**
- gedeonchri**s**t.com ‚úÖ
- gedeonchri**st**.com ‚úÖ  
- gedeonchi**r**st.com ‚ùå

## üß™ Quick Test

After fixing the credentials, test with this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Look for:**
```
Mail transporter configured successfully. Ready to send emails.
```

**Not this:**
```
Error configuring mail transporter: Error: Invalid login
```

---

## üìß Alternative Quick Test

Use this PowerShell script to test SMTP directly:

```powershell
# Save as test-smtp.ps1
$EmailFrom = "saintshub@gedeonchrist.com"
$EmailTo = "your-test-email@gmail.com"
$Subject = "Test Email from Hostinger"
$Body = "This is a test"
$SMTPServer = "smtp.hostinger.com"
$SMTPPort = 465
$Username = "saintshub@gedeonchrist.com"
$Password = "ThisIsMyPass1232"

try {
    $SMTPClient = New-Object Net.Mail.SmtpClient($SMTPServer, $SMTPPort)
    $SMTPClient.EnableSsl = $true
    $SMTPClient.Credentials = New-Object System.Net.NetworkCredential($Username, $Password)
    $SMTPClient.Send($EmailFrom, $EmailTo, $Subject, $Body)
    Write-Host "‚úÖ Email sent successfully!" -ForegroundColor Green
} catch {
    Write-Host "‚ùå Error: $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
}
```
