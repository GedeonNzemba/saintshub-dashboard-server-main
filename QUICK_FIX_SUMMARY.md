# 🎯 Quick Fix Reference - What Just Changed

## 8 Critical Bugs Fixed ✅

---

## 1️⃣ Signout Now Works Properly
**Before:** `/api/signout` didn't invalidate token  
**After:** Token blacklisted immediately  
**Test:** Sign out → try `/api/user` → should fail

---

## 2️⃣ Admin Access Fixed
**Before:** `isAdminCandidate: true` could create churches  
**After:** Only `admin: true` can create churches  
**Test:** Sign up as "it" role → try create church → should get 403

---

## 3️⃣ Church Updates Return Message
**Before:** Only returned church object  
**After:** Includes `{ "message": "Church name updated successfully" }`  
**Test:** Update church name → check response has message

---

## 4️⃣ Token Expiry Fixed
**Before:** Expired tokens caused hanging  
**After:** 30s timeout + clear "session expired" message  
**Test:** Use old token → should get error in < 30 seconds

---

## 5️⃣ Sermon Must Be URL
**Before:** Accepted any text  
**After:** Must be valid http/https URL  
**Test:** Try sermon: "text" → should fail, sermon: "https://..." → should work

---

## 6️⃣ Deacon Deletion Fixed
**Before:** Success message but not deleted  
**After:** Actually removes from database  
**Test:** Delete deacon → refresh church → should be gone

---

## 7️⃣ Trustee Deletion Fixed  
**Before:** Success message but not deleted  
**After:** Actually removes from database  
**Test:** Delete trustee → refresh church → should be gone

---

## 8️⃣ All Church Routes Improved
**Fixed:**
- ✅ Banner deletion (was checking wrong array)
- ✅ All deletions return `remaining<Items>` count
- ✅ Consistent error messages
- ✅ Message property in all responses

## ⚡ Quick Test Commands

```bash
# 1. Test signout
POST /api/signout (with token)
GET /api/user (with same token)
# Expected: "Token has been invalidated"

# 2. Test admin (sign up as "it" role first)
POST /api/dashboard/create-church
# Expected: 403 Forbidden

# 3. Test deacon deletion
DELETE /api/dashboard/churches/{id}/deacon/0
GET /api/dashboard/church/{id}
# Expected: Deacon gone + { "message": "...", "remainingDeacons": X }

# 4. Test sermon validation
POST /api/dashboard/create-church
Body: { ..., "oldServices": [{ "sermon": "not-a-url" }] }
# Expected: Validation error

# 5. Test expired token
Use token > 5 hours old
GET /api/user
# Expected: "Your session has expired" (no hanging)
```

1. **Admin Access:** `isAdminCandidate` no longer grants permissions
   - Must set `admin: true` in database manually
   
2. **Sermon Field:** Must be valid URL
   - Update existing churches if needed
