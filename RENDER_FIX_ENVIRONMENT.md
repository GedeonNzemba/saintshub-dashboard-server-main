# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix: Set NODE_ENV to Production

## Issue
Your health check shows:
```json
"environment": "development"
```

This should be `"production"` for your deployed app.

## Solution

### Go to Render Dashboard

1. Open **https://dashboard.render.com**
2. Click on your service: **`saintshub-dashboard-server-main`**
3. Click **"Environment"** tab (left sidebar)
4. Find the `NODE_ENV` variable
5. Change value from `development` to `production`
6. Click **"Save Changes"**

Render will automatically redeploy with the new setting.

### Or Add if Missing

If `NODE_ENV` doesn't exist:

1. Click **"Add Environment Variable"**
2. Key: `NODE_ENV`
3. Value: `production`
4. Click **"Save Changes"**

## âœ… After Fix

Visit your health endpoint again:

```
https://saintshub-dashboard-server-main.onrender.com/health
```

You should see:
```json
"environment": "production"  âœ…
```

## Why This Matters

- **Security:** Production mode enables security features
- **Performance:** Optimizations are enabled
- **Logging:** Reduces verbose logs
- **Error handling:** Better error messages for production
- **CORS:** Stricter CORS policies apply

**Note:** This is a minor fix. Your API is already working perfectly! This just ensures production optimizations are enabled.
