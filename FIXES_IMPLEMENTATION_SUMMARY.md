## Date: October 19, 2025
## Status: ‚úÖ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

---

## üìä Issues Fixed: 7/7 Complete

### ‚úÖ Issue #1: Prevent Email Updates in User Profile

**Problem:** Users could change their email address via `/api/user/update-user`, creating security risks.

**Solution:**
- Removed `email` from updateable fields
- Only `name` and `surname` can now be updated
- Added clear validation messages
- Excluded password from all responses

**Files Modified:**
- `src/controllers/userController.ts` - Updated `updateUser()` function

**API Change:**
```javascript
// OLD Request Body
{
  "name": "John",
  "surname": "Doe",
  "email": "newemail@example.com" // ‚ùå No longer accepted
}

// NEW Request Body
{
  "name": "John",
  "surname": "Doe"
  // email field removed
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Improved security
- ‚úÖ Prevents email hijacking
- ‚úÖ Forces users to verify email changes through proper channels

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #2: Preserve public_id in Avatar Updates

**Problem:** When updating avatar, `public_id` was lost, keeping only the URL.

**Solution:**
- Enforced requirement for both `public_id` and `url` in avatar updates
- Added validation for avatar object structure
- Added URL format validation
- Preserved data integrity for cloud storage tracking

**Files Modified:**
- `src/controllers/userController.ts` - Updated `updateUserImage()` function

**API Change:**
```javascript
// OLD Request (Lost public_id)
{
  "avatar": {
    "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
    // public_id missing after update
  }
}

// NEW Request (Preserves public_id)
{
  "avatar": {
    "public_id": "unique-identifier-12345",
    "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Data integrity maintained
- ‚úÖ Enables future cloud storage cleanup
- ‚úÖ Consistent avatar structure across all users

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #3: Require Current Password for Password Changes

**Problem:** Users could change passwords without verifying their current password, creating a security vulnerability.

**Solution:**
- Added `currentPassword` requirement
- Verify current password before allowing change
- Added password strength validation (min 8 characters)
- Check that new password differs from current password
- Clear error messages for each validation failure

**Files Modified:**
- `src/controllers/userController.ts` - Updated `updatePassword()` function

**API Change:**
```javascript
// OLD Request (Insecure)
{
  "password": "NewPassword123!",
  "confirmPassword": "NewPassword123!"
  // No current password verification
}

// NEW Request (Secure)
{
  "currentPassword": "OldPassword123!",  // ‚úÖ Required
  "password": "NewPassword123!",
  "confirmPassword": "NewPassword123!"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Prevents unauthorized password changes
- ‚úÖ Protects against session hijacking
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard security practice

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #4: Token Invalidation on Logout

**Problem:** JWT tokens remained valid after logout, allowing continued access to protected routes.

**Solution:**
- Implemented token blacklist system
- Created `src/utils/tokenBlacklist.ts` utility
- Updated `authMiddleware` to check blacklist
- Updated both logout endpoints to add tokens to blacklist
- Automatic cleanup of expired tokens every hour

**Files Created:**
- `src/utils/tokenBlacklist.ts` - Token blacklist management

**Files Modified:**
- `src/middlewares/authMiddleware.ts` - Added blacklist checking
- `src/controllers/userController.ts` - Updated `logoutUser()` function

**How It Works:**
```
1. User logs out ‚Üí Token added to blacklist
2. User tries to access protected route ‚Üí authMiddleware checks blacklist
3. Token found in blacklist ‚Üí 401 Unauthorized
4. Expired tokens automatically removed after 1 hour
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Immediate token invalidation
- ‚úÖ Prevents unauthorized access after logout
- ‚úÖ Production-ready security
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Use Redis in production for multi-server environments

**API Response:**
```javascript
// Logout Response
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully logged out. Token has been invalidated."
}

// Attempting to use logged-out token
{
  "message": "Token has been invalidated. Please log in again.",
  "reason": "logout"
}
```

### ‚úÖ Issue #5: Auto-populate User Info in Church Creation

**Problem:** Clients had to manually provide user information when creating churches, creating data inconsistency risks.

**Solution:**
- Automatically extract user info from JWT token
- Fetch complete user details from database
- Remove user field from request body requirements
- System guarantees correct creator attribution

**Files Modified:**
- `src/routes/authDashboard.ts` - Updated `/create-church` route

**API Change:**
```javascript
// OLD Request Body (User info required)
{
  "name": "Grace Community Church",
  "location": "123 Main St",
  ...,
  "user": {  // ‚ùå Client had to provide this
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "_id": "some-id",
    "image": "https://..."
  }
}

// NEW Request Body (User info auto-populated)
{
  "name": "Grace Community Church",
  "location": "123 Main St",
  ...
  // No user field needed - system handles it automatically
}

// Server automatically adds:
user: {
  name: authenticatedUser.name,
  email: authenticatedUser.email,
  _id: authenticatedUser._id,
  image: authenticatedUser.avatar.url
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Eliminates data inconsistency
- ‚úÖ Prevents user impersonation
- ‚úÖ Simpler client implementation
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed accurate creator tracking

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #6: Restrict Church Creation to Admin Users

**Problem:** Regular users could create churches, allowing unauthorized content creation.

**Solution:**
- Created `adminMiddleware` for authorization
- Applied to `/create-church` route
- Only users with `admin: true` or `isAdminCandidate: true` can create churches
- Clear error messages for unauthorized attempts

**Files Created:**
- `src/middlewares/adminMiddleware.ts` - Admin authorization middleware

**Files Modified:**
- `src/routes/authDashboard.ts` - Added `adminMiddleware` to create-church route

**Access Control:**
```
‚úÖ Allowed:
- Users with admin: true (verified admins)
- Users with isAdminCandidate: true (pastors/IT staff)

‚ùå Denied:
- Regular users (role: 'user')
```

**Error Response for Unauthorized Users:**
```javascript
{
  "message": "Access denied. This action requires administrative privileges.",
  "hint": "Only verified admins or admin candidates (pastors/IT staff) can perform this action.",
  "userRole": {
    "isAdmin": false,
    "isAdminCandidate": false
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Content quality control
- ‚úÖ Prevents spam/abuse
- ‚úÖ Proper role-based access control (RBAC)

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #7: Include Churches in User Response

**Problem:** When fetching user profile (`GET /api/user`), there was no way to see which churches the user created or is associated with. The `churchSelection` field's purpose was unclear.

**Solution:**
- Updated `getUser()` to include churches created by the user
- Added documentation explaining `churchSelection` field
- Churches array shows: _id, name, location, logo, createdAt
- Added `_meta` object with field explanations

**Files Modified:**
- `src/models/User.ts` - Added documentation for churchSelection
- `src/controllers/userController.ts` - Updated `getUser()` function

**API Response:**
```javascript
// NEW Response Format
{
  "_id": "68f527e8274df991152f55e8",
  "name": "Gedeon",
  "surname": "Nzemba",
  "email": "nzemba48@gmail.com",
  "admin": false,
  "avatar": {
    "public_id": "cb2df990-f875-4563-9543-0b0863a7700d",
    "url": "https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
  },
  "language": "en",
  "isAdminCandidate": false,
  "churchSelection": "Grace Community Church",  // Church indicated during signup
  "createdAt": "2025-10-19T18:03:20.339Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-19T19:18:19.107Z",
  
  // ‚úÖ NEW: List of churches created by this user
  "churches": [
    {
      "_id": "68f53d6c274df991152f5601",
      "name": "Grace Community Church",
      "location": "123 Main Street, New York, NY 10001",
      "logo": "https://example.com/logo.png",
      "createdAt": "2025-10-19T19:35:08.562Z"
    }
  ],
  
  // ‚úÖ NEW: Field explanations
  "_meta": {
    "churchSelectionInfo": "This is the church the user indicated during signup (for admin verification)"
  }
}
```

**churchSelection Field Explanation:**
- **Purpose:** Stores the church ID or custom church name that a user selected/entered during signup
- **Use Case:** When pastor or IT staff sign up, they indicate which church they want to manage
- **Admin Use:** Helps admins verify and associate users with the correct church
- **Not the same as:** The `churches` array (which shows churches the user has actually created)

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Complete user profile information
- ‚úÖ Easy tracking of user's churches
- ‚úÖ Clear understanding of data relationships
- ‚úÖ Better admin dashboard capabilities
