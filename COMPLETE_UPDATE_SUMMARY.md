## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

### For Production Deployment

1. **Token Blacklist Storage**
   - Current: In-memory (lost on server restart)
   - Production: **MUST use Redis or Database**
   - See: `src/utils/tokenBlacklist.ts` TODO comments

2. **Church Deletion Behavior**
   - Current: Deletes all user's churches
   - Consider: Keep churches or reassign to admin
   - Configurable in `userController.ts` deleteUserAccount function

3. **Data Recovery**
   - Current: No recovery possible
   - Consider: Soft delete with grace period
   - Consider: Data export before deletion

4. **Compliance**
   - GDPR: Right to be forgotten ‚úÖ
   - Data portability: Not yet implemented
   - Audit trail: Add logging for compliance
