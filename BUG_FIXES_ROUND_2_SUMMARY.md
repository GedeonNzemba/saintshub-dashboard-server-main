# 🔧 Bug Fixes Round 2 - Complete Summary

## Date: October 19, 2025
## Session: Critical Issues from Postman Testing

---

## 🎯 Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue #1: /api/signout Not Invalidating Token ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- User could use `/api/signout` but token remained valid
- Could still access protected routes after signout
- Only `/api/user/logout` was adding tokens to blacklist

**Root Cause:**
- `/api/signout` was only clearing cookies, not blacklisting the JWT token

**Solution:**
- Replaced custom signout logic with `logoutUser` controller
- Now both `/api/signout` and `/api/user/logout` use the same secure logout mechanism
- Token is immediately added to blacklist upon signout

**Files Modified:**
- `src/routes/authRoutes.ts` - Line 208

**Before:**
```typescript
router.post("/signout", (req, res) => {
  res.clearCookie("token");
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Sign-out successful." });
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
router.post("/signout", authMiddleware, userController.logoutUser);
```

**Testing:**
1. Sign out using `/api/signout`
2. Try to access `/api/user`
3. ✅ Should get "Token has been invalidated" error

---

### Issue #2: Admin Check Too Lenient ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Users with `"admin": false` but `"isAdminCandidate": true` could create churches
- User signed up with "it" role but couldn't create church (correctly blocked now)
- `isAdminCandidate` should only mean "pending approval", not "has access"

**Root Cause:**
- `adminMiddleware.ts` was checking: `user.admin || user.isAdminCandidate`
- This gave access to unapproved admin candidates

**Solution:**
- Changed to check ONLY `user.admin === true`
- Added helpful error messages for admin candidates waiting for approval
- Updated documentation to clarify access control logic

**Files Modified:**
- `src/middlewares/adminMiddleware.ts` - Lines 12, 52-63

**Before:**
```typescript
const hasAdminAccess = user.admin || user.isAdminCandidate;
```

**After:**
```typescript
// IMPORTANT: Only users with admin: true can create churches
const hasAdminAccess = user.admin === true;
```

**Error Messages:**
- Admin candidates: "Your admin request is pending. Please wait for verification..."
- Regular users: "Only verified administrators can perform this action..."

**Testing:**
1. Sign up with "it" or "pastor" role → `isAdminCandidate: true`
2. Try to create church → ✅ Should get 403 Forbidden
3. System admin must manually set `admin: true` in database
4. Then user can create churches

---

### Issue #3: Church Update Missing Message ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- PATCH `/api/dashboard/churches/:id/:field` returned only the church object
- No `message` property for frontend to display success feedback

**Root Cause:**
- Response format was inconsistent with other endpoints

**Solution:**
- Added `message` property to all responses
- Improved validation (check if field value exists in request)
- Better error messages with hints

**Files Modified:**
- `src/routes/authDashboard.ts` - Lines 113-143

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "message": "Church name updated successfully",
  "church": { ...churchData... }
}
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Validates field exists in request body
- ✅ Returns 404 if church not found
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Consistent message format

---

### Issue #4: Token Expiration Causing Hangs ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Expired tokens (after 5 hours) caused Postman to hang with "Sending request..."
- Sometimes worked, sometimes hung indefinitely
- No timeout configured

**Root Cause:**
- No request timeout configured on server
- JWT verification errors not providing specific messages for expired tokens

**Solution:**
1. Added 30-second timeout for all requests
2. Improved expired token error messages
3. Better error differentiation (expired vs invalid)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/index.ts` - Lines 31-36 (added timeout middleware)
- `src/middlewares/authMiddleware.ts` - Lines 46-56 (better error messages)

**Timeout Middleware:**
```typescript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  req.setTimeout(30000); // 30 seconds
  res.setTimeout(30000);
  next();
});
```

**Improved Error Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Your session has expired. Please log in again.",
  "hint": "Please sign in again to continue"
}
```

**Testing:**
1. Use token older than 5 hours
2. ✅ Should get clear "session expired" message within 30 seconds
3. No more hanging requests

---

### Issue #5: Sermon Field Not Validated as URL ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- `oldServices[].sermon` and `liveServices[].sermon` allowed plain text
- Should only accept valid URLs (links to sermon videos/audio)

**Root Cause:**
- No validation on the sermon field
- Schema accepted any string value

**Solution:**
- Added pre-save hook to validate sermon URLs
- Uses URL parsing to ensure valid http/https URLs
- Clear error messages indicate which service has invalid URL

**Files Modified:**
- `src/models/Space.ts` - Lines 67-106

**Validation Logic:**
```typescript
const isValidUrl = (url: string): boolean => {
  try {
    const parsedUrl = new URL(url);
    return parsedUrl.protocol === 'http:' || parsedUrl.protocol === 'https:';
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
};

ChurchSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  // Validate oldServices sermon URLs
  // Validate liveServices sermon URLs
  // Return specific error if invalid
});
```

**Error Example:**
```
"oldServices[0].sermon must be a valid URL (e.g., https://example.com/sermon)"
```

**Testing:**
1. Try to create/update church with sermon: "The Power of Resurrection"
2. ✅ Should get validation error
3. Use sermon: "https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123"
4. ✅ Should work

### Issue #6: Deacon/Trustee Deletion Not Persisting ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- DELETE `/api/dashboard/churches/:id/deacon/:index` returned success
- But deacon still appeared when fetching church details
- Same issue with trustees

**Root Cause:**
- `securities` is defined as generic `Object` in schema
- Mongoose doesn't automatically track changes to nested objects
- Need to call `markModified()` to tell Mongoose the field changed

**Solution:**
- Added `church.markModified('securities')` after splice
- Improved all deletion routes with consistent error messages
- Added `remainingDeacons`/`remainingTrustees` count in response

**Files Modified:**
- `src/routes/authDashboard.ts` - Lines 369-411 (deacons), 413-457 (trustees)

**Critical Fix:**
```typescript
church.securities.deacons.splice(deaconIndex, 1);

// IMPORTANT: Mark the nested object as modified for Mongoose to save it
church.markModified('securities');

await church.save();
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "message": "Deacon deleted successfully",
  "remainingDeacons": 2
}
```

**Testing:**
1. Delete deacon at index 0
2. Fetch church details
3. ✅ Deacon should be gone
4. Same for trustees

### Issue #7: Postman Routes Showing "Request not found" ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- "Delete Song", "Upload to Cloudinary", "Upload File Locally", "Verse of the Day" showing "Request not found"

**Root Cause:**
- Routes exist in code (verified)
- Issue was with Postman collection not being re-imported or requests not saved

**Solution:**
- All routes verified to exist in codebase:
  - ✅ `/api/upload-file-to-cloud` - exists
  - ✅ `/api/upload-file` - exists
  - ✅ `/verse-of-the-day` - exists (NOTE: no /api prefix)
  - ✅ `/api/dashboard/churches/:id/song/:index` - exists

**Action Required:**
- Re-import Postman collection: `Saintshub_API.postman_collection.json`
- All routes are properly configured

**Note:** `/verse-of-the-day` is mounted directly on app, not under `/api` prefix

---

### Issue #8: Church Management Routes Audit ✅ COMPLETED

**Problem:**
- Inconsistent error messages across church CRUD operations
- Missing `message` properties for frontend feedback
- Banner deletion had bug (checking gallery.length instead of banner.length)

**Solution:**
- Standardized all deletion routes with consistent format
- Added `message` property to all responses
- Fixed banner length validation bug
- Improved all error messages with clear hints

**Files Modified:**
- `src/routes/authDashboard.ts` - Multiple sections

**Improvements Made:**

1. **PATCH /churches/:id** (Update multiple fields)
   - ✅ Validates request body not empty
   - ✅ Returns 404 if church not found
   - ✅ Runs validators on update
   - ✅ Handles validation errors gracefully
   - ✅ Returns message + updated church

2. **DELETE /church/:id** (Delete church)
   - ✅ Returns deleted church ID and name
   - ✅ Clear success message

3. **DELETE Gallery Image**
   - ✅ Returns `remainingImages` count
   - ✅ Validates index range

4. **DELETE Banner Image** (BUG FIX!)
   - ✅ Fixed: Was checking `gallery.length` instead of `banner.length`
   - ✅ Now correctly validates banner index
   - ✅ Returns `remainingBanners` count

5. **DELETE Past Service**
   - ✅ Returns `remainingServices` count
   - ✅ Better error messages

6. **DELETE Deacon** (Already fixed in Issue #6)
   - ✅ `markModified('securities')`
   - ✅ Returns `remainingDeacons`

7. **DELETE Trustee** (Already fixed in Issue #6)
   - ✅ `markModified('securities')`
   - ✅ Returns `remainingTrustees`

8. **DELETE Song**
   - ✅ Returns `remainingSongs` count
   - ✅ Consistent error format

9. **DELETE Live Service**
   - ✅ Returns `remainingLiveServices` count
   - ✅ Fixed error message (was "Invalid song index")

**Standard Response Format:**
```json
{
  "message": "Item deleted successfully",
  "remaining<Items>": 3,
  "error": "Error type" // only on errors
}
```

## 🚀 Testing Checklist

### Priority 1: Critical Fixes
- [ ] **Test signout**: Use `/api/signout`, verify token is invalid
- [ ] **Test admin access**: Sign up as "it" role, try creating church (should fail)
- [ ] **Test deacon deletion**: Delete deacon, refresh church, verify it's gone
- [ ] **Test trustee deletion**: Delete trustee, refresh church, verify it's gone

### Priority 2: Validation
- [ ] **Test sermon URL**: Try creating church with non-URL sermon (should fail)
- [ ] **Test sermon URL**: Create church with valid URL (should work)

### Priority 3: User Experience
- [ ] **Test expired token**: Use old token, verify clear error message
- [ ] **Test church updates**: Update church name, verify message in response
- [ ] **Test all deletions**: Each deletion should return `remaining<Items>` count

## 💡 Important Notes for Frontend Development

### 1. Admin System Changes
```typescript
// Before: isAdminCandidate could create churches
// After: Only admin: true can create churches

// Frontend should show:
if (user.isAdminCandidate && !user.admin) {
  showMessage("Your admin request is pending approval");
}
```

### 2. Response Messages
All endpoints now include `message` property:
```typescript
const response = await api.updateChurch(id, data);
showToast(response.message); // "Church name updated successfully"
```

### 3. Deletion Confirmations
Use the `remaining<Items>` counts for UI feedback:
```typescript
const response = await api.deleteDeacon(churchId, index);
showToast(`${response.message}. ${response.remainingDeacons} deacons remaining.`);
```

### 4. Sermon URL Validation
Frontend should validate before sending:
```typescript
const isValidSermonUrl = (url: string) => {
  try {
    const parsed = new URL(url);
    return parsed.protocol === 'http:' || parsed.protocol === 'https:';
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
};
```

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### 1. Admin Access (BREAKING)
**Before:** `isAdminCandidate: true` could create churches  
**After:** Only `admin: true` can create churches

**Migration:**
- System admins must manually approve users by setting `admin: true`
- Or create admin approval workflow in frontend

### 2. Sermon Field Validation (BREAKING)
**Before:** Accepted any string  
**After:** Must be valid URL

**Migration:**
- Update existing churches with invalid sermon URLs
- Or temporarily remove validation for old data

1. ✅ Token blacklist now works for all logout methods
2. ✅ Stricter admin access control
3. ✅ Request timeouts prevent DOS
4. ✅ Better input validation (sermon URLs)
5. ✅ Consistent error messages (no information leakage)

---
